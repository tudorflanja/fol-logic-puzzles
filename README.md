# 🧠 First-Order Logic Puzzles + Tkinter GUI

This project implements a collection of **First-Order Logic (FOL) puzzles** solved using **Prover9** and **Mace4**, paired with a **Python Tkinter GUI** that allows users to interactively explore each puzzle, read the clues, and reveal the computed solutions.
 
All logic constraints, models, and GUI components are built manually to demonstrate reasoning, model generation, and practical use of FOL tools.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 **Four Fully Modeled FOL Logic Puzzles**
  - Placings  
  - First and Last Names  
  - Toddlers and Teddies  
  - Books, Books and More Books

- 🔍 **Prover9 / Mace4 Integration**  
  Each puzzle is encoded in FOL format.  
  Prover9 and Mace4 generate valid models or verify constraints.

- 🪟 **Interactive Tkinter GUI**
  - Switch between puzzles using tabs or buttons  
  - Display puzzle descriptions and logical clues  
  - Show solutions generated by the FOL models  
  - Clean, intuitive layout 

- 🧠 **Clear Logical Structure**
  - Domain definition  
  - Uniqueness constraints  
  - Predicate design  
  - Clue–to–FOL translation for each puzzle

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
  - Tkinter for GUI interface  
  - Scripted functions to load puzzle data and display solutions  

- **Prover9** – Automated theorem prover  
- **Mace4** – Model generator used for finite-domain logic puzzles  
- **FOL Modeling** – Complete rule encoding for all puzzles

## 🛠️ Application Overview

This project contains **four classical logic puzzles**, each represented by a set of First-Order Logic constraints.  
The FOL files (e.g., `placings`, `firstLastNames`, `books`, `toddlersAndTeddies`) include:

- domain definitions  
- uniqueness constraints  
- logical predicates (e.g., `next(x,y)`, name–series associations, ages, teddies)  
- clue translation into logic rules  
- Prover9/Mace4 compatible syntax  

### 🔹 Included Puzzles

#### 1. **Placings**  
A race ordering puzzle with ten constraints.  
Uses **Prover9** due to the large model size.

#### 2. **First and Last Names**  
Match five people to their corresponding surnames using clues about hiking, children, gender, and hospital visits.

#### 3. **Toddlers and Teddies**  
Determine each child's age and teddy count using constraints such as:
- unique teddy counts  
- relative ages  
- exactly one matching age–teddy pair  

#### 4. **Books, Books and More Books**  
Assign each boy his favorite book series based on:
- preference for mysteries vs fantasy  
- character names  
- costume clues (e.g., glasses and black robe → Harry Potter)

## 💻 How the GUI Works

The GUI provides an accessible interface for navigating puzzles and revealing answers:

1. Displays four buttons—one per puzzle.  
2. For each puzzle, the GUI shows:
   - The puzzle description  
   - The logical clue list  
   - A **Show Answer** button that reveals the solution  
3. Built using Tkinter widgets:
   - `Label` for puzzle text  
   - `Button` for interaction  
4. Solutions are loaded from the project's puzzle model files.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies
You only need Python and Tkinter:

sudo apt install python3 python3-tk

---

### 2. Run the GUI
Inside the logicsGUI folder:

python3 gui.py

---

### 3. Running the Puzzle Models
To generate or verify logic models manually:

prover9 -f placings
mace4 -f books
mace4 -f firstLastNames
mace4 -f toddlersAndTeddies

Note:
The Placings puzzle must be run with Prover9 because Mace4 cannot generate a model large enough.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Translation of textual clues into First-Order Logic
- Finite model generation with Mace4
- Theorem proving with Prover9
- Successor relations (next) in ordering problems
- Uniqueness and domain constraints
- Tkinter GUI design for educational logic tools

## 📝 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how First-Order Logic, combined with automated reasoning tools (Prover9 and Mace4), can be used to formally solve classic logic puzzles.
A simple yet effective Tkinter GUI makes the puzzles interactive and easy to study.

This project serves as an example of:

- logic modeling
- constraint reasoning
- educational GUI development
- automated deduction
- Python integration with logic-based tools
