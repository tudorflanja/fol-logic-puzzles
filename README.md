# 🧠 First-Order Logic Puzzles + Tkinter GUI

This project implements a collection of **First-Order Logic (FOL) puzzles** solved using **Prover9** and **Mace4**, paired with a **Python Tkinter GUI** that allows users to interactively explore each puzzle, read the clues, and reveal the computed solutions.

The work is based on laboratory tasks from the **Artificial Intelligence** course at the *Technical University of Cluj-Napoca*.  
All logic constraints, models, and GUI components are built manually to demonstrate reasoning, model generation, and practical use of FOL tools.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 **Four Fully Modeled FOL Logic Puzzles**
  - Placings  
  - First and Last Names  
  - Toddlers and Teddies  
  - Books, Books and More Books

- 🔍 **Prover9 / Mace4 Integration**  
  Each puzzle is encoded in FOL format.  
  Prover9 and Mace4 generate valid models or verify constraints.

- 🪟 **Interactive Tkinter GUI**
  - Switch between puzzles using tabs or buttons  
  - Display puzzle descriptions and logical clues  
  - Show solutions generated by the FOL models  
  - Clean, intuitive layout (see GUI screenshots in PDF pages 12–13) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- 🧠 **Clear Logical Structure**
  - Domain definition  
  - Uniqueness constraints  
  - Predicate design  
  - Clue–to–FOL translation for each puzzle

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
  - Tkinter for GUI interface  
  - Scripted functions to load puzzle data and display solutions  

- **Prover9** – Automated theorem prover  
- **Mace4** – Model generator used for finite-domain logic puzzles  
- **FOL Modeling** – Complete rule encoding for all puzzles  
- **LaTeX** – Original project documentation (file: `is.tex`)

## 🛠️ Application Overview

This project contains **four classical logic puzzles**, each represented by a set of First-Order Logic constraints.  
The FOL files (e.g., `placings`, `firstLastNames`, `books`, `toddlersAndTeddies`) include:

- domain definitions  
- uniqueness constraints  
- logical predicates (e.g., `next(x,y)`, name–series associations, ages, teddies)  
- clue translation into logic rules  
- Prover9/Mace4 compatible syntax  

### 🔹 Included Puzzles

#### 1. **Placings**  
A race ordering puzzle with ten constraints.  
Uses **Prover9** due to the large model size (as described in the PDF) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

#### 2. **First and Last Names**  
Match five people to their corresponding surnames using clues about hiking, children, gender, and hospital visits.

#### 3. **Toddlers and Teddies**  
Determine each child's age and teddy count using constraints such as:
- unique teddy counts  
- relative ages  
- exactly one matching age–teddy pair  
Solution summary appears on page 9 of the PDF :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

#### 4. **Books, Books and More Books**  
Assign each boy his favorite book series based on:
- preference for mysteries vs fantasy  
- character names  
- costume clues (e.g., glasses and black robe → Harry Potter)

## 💻 How the GUI Works

The GUI (shown in PDF pages 12–13) provides an accessible interface for navigating puzzles and revealing answers:

1. Displays four buttons—one per puzzle.  
2. For each puzzle, the GUI shows:
   - The puzzle description  
   - The logical clue list  
   - A **Show Answer** button that reveals the solution  
3. Built using Tkinter widgets:
   - `Label` for puzzle text  
   - `Button` for interaction  
4. Solutions are loaded from the project's puzzle model files.
